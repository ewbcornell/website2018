                                Ithaca area.
                                On the business side, students conduct several fundraisers and campaigns throughout the school year;
                                such as the Charity Concert, fundraising campaigns, an annual Skate Night, and several sales ranging from bakesales to
                                finals week care package sales. Additionally the business team maintains relations with our corporate sponsors, donors,
                                and alumni to keep them informed and involved with the team.

                            <p>Our chapter has partnered with the community of Ilagala in Tanzania for our second international project. The community currently facing rainwater shortage during the dry season due to the effects of climate change and human-induced land degradation. As the main contributor to Ilagala’s growing economy is the agriculture industry, water shortage is severely impacting their livelihoods. Their crops (including cashews, coffee, tea, cocoa, and tobacco) and livestock have been severely impacted and the prevalence of crop pests and diseases has increased. </p>

                            <p>This past summer, three of our team members travelled to Ilagala to meet the community for the first time and collect the necessary data to design an irrigation water system that will alleviate some of the community’s concerns. This upcoming semester the team will be working on a feasibility study for the irrigation system, as well as doing further research to determine what other courses of projects can help the community and whether additional information needs to be collected to finalize an irrigation system design that can be implemented.  </p>

In partnership with a newly formed organization Every1s Home we completed a set of designs for portable trailer homes, called E-Pods.  Designed with input from members of the homeless populations of San Francisco, California as well as Binghamton, New York these E-Pods will provide temporary housing for individuals in the transition period from homelessness to stable housing.  In the coming months, we will be selecting our next domestic project.  We are currently in contact with the Finger Lakes Land Trust about the possibility of building a suspension bridge to improve accessibility of the local park system.

                                our first project as an EWB chapter. Through the help of an NGO in Bolivia, Engineers
                                in Action, we have taken on two projects with this community.

                                we implemented a 50 meter suspension bridge that connected the community to their
                                farmland. Previously, the farmland was inaccesible during the wet season because of a dangerous river, but
                                now with the bridge the community has year-round access.

                            <p>In the summer of 2017 we shifted our focus to improve the communities water access.
                                We lengthened and lined their irrigation channels to increase water flow, fixed the tiling in their water storage tank, and installed gabions to prevent erosion near the bridge foundations.</p>
